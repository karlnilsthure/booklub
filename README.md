### Final project at </ salt >

The requirements for the final 2 weeks project were:

- Must be full stack
- Must use React/Vue & Node
- Must persist some data in a database
- Must work and be demoable at end of each week
- Ensure that it's easy to get from Git
- Must work in strict mob, so that all of you have touched all parts of the project. No splitting up!

Our mob has 4 members:
- Andrea Gylling (https://github.com/andreagylling)
- Oana Fatu (https://github.com/oanafatu)
- László Bottlik (https://github.com/dadinho)
- Nils Andersson (https://github.com/karlnilsthure)

Among the technologies we used:
- React, styled components and some other libraries for the front end
- REST API with express for the backend 
- Postgres as relational database
- Google authentication for managing login in the app

Working with Scrum, we: 
- wrote user stories ('As a user I want to .. so that ..')
- estimated user stories using relative estimation
- started with a sprint 0 were we set up the environment: database structure and fake data (build up a migration script), basic express server set up & npx create react app
- planned sprint 1 by prioritizing the user stories
- developed based on the sprint backlog, adding new user stories to the product backlog on the way, as we found them out
- did a demo after first week, a working app with basic functionalities
- did a planning for sprint 2 out of the product backlog, we had to prioritize again so that we have a fully working app by the end of the week.
